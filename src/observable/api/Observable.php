 * a refinement of SplSubject.
 * provides for named events, filtered subscriptions, and passing arbitrary data with updates.
 *
 * implementations MUST be completely interoperable with the native SplSubject/SplObserver interfaces.
 *
 * implementations should document what events they send notifications on.
 * the following annotation format is recommended:
 *    '@observable "<event name>"( <update argument list> )'
 *
 * event names are arbitrary.
 * it is suggested that event names be comprised of "word" characters (\w),
 * thereby allowing for name hierarchies delimited by non-word characters (\W).
