util
====

Various PHP utility classes and interfaces/traits for general use.

dependencies
------------

Requires:

* php 7.0 or later
* Exceptable 1.1 or later (`composer require php-enspired/exceptable`)

installation
------------

_at\util_ is currently **unreleased**.  It is **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE**.

I don't expect much to change before release, but until then, you'll have to clone it and manually `composer install` if you want to play around with it.

docs
----

â€¦forthcoming

tests
-----

Run tests with `composer test:unit`.  Current tests cover `ArrayTools`, `DateTimeable`, `PDO`, and `Validator`.
